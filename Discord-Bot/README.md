#1. Getting an API

To get an API, you need to go to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a new application.
Within your newly created application you will look to the left side of your screen and select "Bot" 
After choosing a name for your bot, and a profile picture to represent it, you will click the button called "click to reveal token", copy that and be prepared to add it to your code.
